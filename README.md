# Nutritional Health Calculator

This was one of my earliest Python projects, me and two other team members created this as a final of an introductory computer science course. The app is a basic **personal health dashboard**, allowing users to create a profile, calculate their BMI, assess physical health, and track daily nutrition intake.

> *Note: This project was built using early Python and Tkinter knowledge. The code is not actively maintained and may not run without modifications.*
